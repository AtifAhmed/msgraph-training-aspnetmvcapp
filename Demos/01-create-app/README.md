# Completed module: Create an ASP.NET MVC web app

The version of the project in this directory reflects completing the tutorial up through [Create an ASP.NET MVC web app](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/training/aspnet-tutorial?tutorial-step=1). If you use this version of the project, you need to complete the rest of the tutorial starting at [Register the app in the portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/training/aspnet-tutorial?tutorial-step=2).

Installing NuGet packages adds content to the /packages, /Content & /Scripts folders. The files within the /Content & /Scripts folders frequently contain 3rd party libraries which do not include redistributable licenses. Therefore the files in these folders are not included in the repository. The NuGet restore process will not repopulate these folders, only a NuGet reinstall of the package will do that. Therefore you will need to reinstall all packages using the NuGet CLI to repopulate these folders if you want to run the final built solution locally. Refer to the following for more information: [Microsoft Docs – How to reinstall and update packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/reinstalling-and-updating-packages).”
